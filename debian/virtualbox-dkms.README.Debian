virtualbox for Debian
-------------------------

 - Starting with version 3.0.10 virtualbox uses dkms(8) to build the
   modules automatically. The dkms package recommends the linux-headers
   package needed to build modules for the current distribution kernel. If this
   for whatever reason does not work or you are using a non-distribution kernel
   please make sure the right set of kernel headers is installed.
